# Team Atwater's Project 2
### Goals
For Project 2, we are interested in studying low-cost, affordable diets for marginalized populations in the US below the income threshold with type 2 diabetes.

Our goals include:
1. Evaluate nutritional content of diets for low-income communities in food deserts
2. Develop meal plans for families restricted by type 2 diabetes by income level
3. Mimic cultural diets

### Download Instructions for Peer Reviewers

1. Click on the green "Code" button -> Download ZIP
2. Extract the files locally. You should now have a folder in your files titled "Atwater-Project-2-main" with the needed files.
3. Navigate to the following datahub directory destination: /EEP153_Materials/Project 2
4. Upload the 5 files: Project 2 Notebook.ipynb, atwater_diet_minimums.csv, and atwater_diet_maximums.csv, Budget_Friendly_Diabetes_Diet.csv, and Dash_Diet.csv into /EEP153_Materials/Project 2. Please note that if these files are placed in different folders or directories our code will not work because it will be extracting other tools and files (f.e. eep153_tools.py, requirements.txt, etc.) from their respective file locations! :~)
